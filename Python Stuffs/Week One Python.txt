Hello, 

I placed this in a text file as the website I take my schooling through doesn't allow me to send in just a comment. I hope this was the way it was supposed to be submitted. 

On Github my tag is HyperionSmith, I finish the bio and icon but I don't feel comfortable putting a picture on me on the internet. More over, after taking the security course last semester I don't feel comfortable putting much information in my bio either. I prefer to remain vague online. I pick the icon because I worked in kitchens and became a chef for a nearly half my life.
